-	Vine percentage for 5-star reviews: 51.1%
-	Non-Vine total reviews: 40,471
-	Non-Vine reviews that were 5-stars: 15,663
-	Non-vine percentage for 5-star reviews: 38.7%

## Summary
There is a bias toward 5-star reviews compared to Vine reviews to Non-Vine reviews. Vine percentage 5-star reviews were 51.1% and the non-vine 5-star reviews were 38.7%. That is a 12.4% difference between Vine reviews and Non-Vine reviews. Amazon vine reviewers are customers who leave a lot of reviews, this can cause customers to leave random reviews so they can receive free gear. This can cause the user to have a bias and leave 5-star reviews for every product. Another analysis I would like to conduct is determine by user how often a vine member leaves 5-star reviews for products they receive.
